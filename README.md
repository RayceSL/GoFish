Goals of this project:

1. Take user input.

2. Choose number of players (bots).

3. Bots should make somewhat intelligent choices... Somewhat... I'll do my best.

Rules of Go-Fish (According to Bicycle.com):

0. Remove Jokers, aces are high (why are aces high? It shouldn't matter, but Bicycle knows best, I guess.)

1. Each player draws a card from the top of the deck (shuffled). The player who drew the least valuable card becomes the dealer.

2. The dealer shuffles the deck, and the player to the right cuts it. The deal proceeds clockwise one card at a time, until all players have the appropriate amount of cards; For 2-3 players: 7 cards; For 4-5 players: 5 cards. The rest of the deck is left face-down at the center of the tablue and is called the "stock."

3. The player clockwise to the dealer is the first to go. They choose another player to take cards from, and ask for all their cards of a rank that matches at least one card in their hand---that is, they can't ask for a rank they don't already have. If the addressed player has no cards of the specified rank, then the player whose turn it is must take a card from the top of the stock* (called "going fishing") and their turn ends. Play proceeds clockwise.

4. As long as a player doesn't have to go fish, their turn continues.

5. Once a player has four-of-a-kind, called a "book," they remove the book and put in face-up in front of them. So long as they don't go fish, they continue their turn.

6. If a player has no cards, they may first take a card from the stock, then their turn proceeds normally. If there are no cards in the stock, they lose and are out of the game.

* If a player has cards, is told to go fish, but the stock is empty, then they stay in the game and simply don't take any cards from the empty stock.
