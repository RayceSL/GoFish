Rules of Go-Fish (According to Bicycle.com):

0. Remove Jokers, aces are high

1. Each player takes a card from the top of the deck (shuffled). The player who took the least valuable card becomes the dealer.

2. The dealer shuffles the deck, and the player to the right cuts it. The deal proceeds clockwise one at a time, until players have the appropriate amount of cards. For 2-3 players: 7 cards. For 4-5 players: 5 cards. The rest of the deck is left face-down and called the "stock."

3. The player clockwise to the dealer is the first to go. They choose another player and ask for all their cards of a rank that matches at least one other card in their hand; that is, they can't ask for a card they don't already have. If the addressed player has no cards of the specified rank, then the player whose turn it is must take a card from the top of the stock and their turn ends.

4. As long as a player doesn't have to "go fish," their turn continues.

5. Once a player has four-of-a-kind, called a "book," they remove the book and put in face-up in front of them.

6. If a player has no cards, they take a card from the stock and ask for cards. If there are no cards in the stock, they lose and are out of the game.
